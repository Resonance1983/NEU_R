Many times, there are lists of options to choose from, but no indication why I should choose one or the other - in some cases, there were a few options that I would have selected together, but I was only able to select one. I ended up just starting to select answers that I knew would move the game along more quickly because it was really annoying and not at all interesting or enjoyable to play. I really like the idea of the game, but there is no way that this, the way it is designed, is going to help anyone learn anything about going to court. ",Yes,"I was the defendant in a family law case that lasted a number of years. I started with a lawyer, but ended up representing myself, successfully. "

At one point I wondered about an ""all of the above"" option.  Also, I think an introduction to the game would be helpful, to describe how it was to be played and what to expect. Very brief though.",Yes,"Quite. My first experiences probably had to do with me being an expert witness as a School Psychologist testifying about IQ - I was subpoena'd without an attorney preparing me for the case, although I learned a bit from school. Next I worked for CPS so at least weekly wrote and presented reports at review hearings. I also testified and helped DOJ prepare cases for termination of parental rights and worked closely with DAs on sex abuse cases. All were fine, although divorce court is different. I did have an attorney for a matter leading up to the divorce, which resulted in an all day hearing. The Judge had me testify as an expert witness about a psychologist's findings related to my ex-husband since the expert wasn't there. It was strange, and yet felt the same as when on the stand other times. We had some sort of settlement phone call while I was represented and that was difficult as my attorney was in a different city and the Judge in yet another city. For a modification hearing I was represented, although my ex-husband (an attorney and represented) derailed the process. I later had to go back to court when ex-husband filed to modify child support - due to lack of money (his game was to run me out of money), I represented myself. I anticipate having to go back to court again, and still feel exceptionally ill-equipped and mystified by the process. I would be happy to help with this game, as I am passionate about supporting efforts that could improve the system. That said, it would be strange to leave my name and number. Wishing you the very best of luck and thank you for your work :)"
